This repo may or may not work. I use it to experiment with different things and to keep a checkpoint.

1. Clone this repo.

2. Create `.env` file with your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_API_KEY`.
   You're responsible for any credit usage. This app is not optimized to minimize credit usage.

3. A lot of things may or may not be commented out depending on what I was testing. Look at what's commented and maybe uncomment it.

4. To run the app, use the following:
   ```
   docker compose run --build --rm app
   ```
